The brown discharge should be temporary. I would recommend you have a period for the next couple of months and not skip the placebo pills temporarily to get back on track. If you have not missed any pills, pregnancy is very unlikely, but I would recommend a pregnancy test for added reassurance. If you have not had a recent test for STDs, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, I would also get tested for those, as these infections may have no symptoms and can cause spotting or bleeding after intercourse.

You may repeat the test in a week to rule out pregnancy, or you can do a serum beta hCG test. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/ml, then you are not pregnant. The reasons are anovulatory cycles seen in PCOD, or you should get a semen analysis done once for your partner.", "palm2_prediction": "**Possible reasons for negative pregnancy tests:**\n\n- **Early pregnancy:** If you are still in the early stages of pregnancy, the levels of pregnancy hormones (hCG) may be too low to be detected by a home pregnancy test. Repeat the test in a few days or consult a doctor for a blood test to confirm pregnancy.\n\n- **Irregular ovulation:** PCOS can affect ovulation, making it difficult to predict the exact time of ovulation. If you ovulated later than expected this month, implantation may have occurred recently, and hCG levels may not be high enough for detection yet.\n\n- **Chemical pregnancy:** Sometimes, a fertilized egg implants but fails to develop properly, leading to a very early miscarriage known as a chemical pregnancy. This can result in a brief rise in hCG levels, which may be detected by a pregnancy test, but then decline, leading to a negative result later on.\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy:** In rare cases, pregnancy can occur outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). This can cause symptoms similar to a normal pregnancy, but the pregnancy cannot develop successfully. Ectopic pregnancies require medical attention.\n\n- **Medical conditions:** Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid problems or pituitary gland disorders, can affect hormone levels and interfere with pregnancy testing.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nIf you continue to experience missed periods and have concerns about pregnancy, it is advisable to consult a doctor for further evaluation, including a blood test to accurately determine pregnancy status and rule out any underlying medical conditions.", "Average_accuracy_score": 2.5, "Average_completeness_score": 2.5, "Average_specific_scores": 2.5}

{"Question": "Hello doctor,If both the testes experience a reduction in blood supply (and thus oxygen and hormones), in the long run will it increase the risk of more spontaneous mutation present in sperms as lesser blood supply will affect the DNA replication and repairing ability of spermatogonial cells?", "Doctor_Response": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your query. What you have mentioned is theoretically true, however reduction in blood supply and hormones will lead to atrophy of the testis and a decrease/ absence in sperm production eventually. Also right now it is clinically impossible to assess the presence of specific mutations in single sperm. What is measured is indirectly the levels of DNA damage. For more information consult an an ChatDoctor. ChatDoctor/ask-a-doctor-online/an", "palm2_prediction": "Yes, reduced blood supply to the testes can increase the risk of spontaneous mutations in sperm. Here's how:\n\n1. **Hypoxia:** Low oxygen levels (hypoxia) caused by reduced blood supply can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are harmful molecules that can damage DNA. This damage can cause mutations in the genetic material of sperm cells.\n\n2. **Impaired DNA Repair:** The process of DNA replication and repair requires energy and oxygen. When the blood supply is reduced, there may be insufficient energy and oxygen available for these processes to occur efficiently. This can lead to an accumulation of DNA damage and an increased risk of mutations.\n\n3. **Altered Gene Expression:** Reduced blood supply can affect the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. This can disrupt the normal functioning of these processes and increase the likelihood of mutations occurring.\n\n4. **Apoptosis Inhibition:** Normally, damaged cells undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) to prevent them from contributing to disease. However, reduced blood supply can inhibit apoptosis, allowing damaged cells to survive and potentially give rise to mutated sperm.\n\n5. **Long-Term Effects:** Over time, the accumulation of mutations in sperm cells can increase the risk of genetic disorders and infertility in offspring.\n\nTherefore, reduced blood supply to the testes can have significant consequences for male fertility and genetic health.", "Average_accuracy_score": 2.5, "Average_completeness_score": 2.5, "Average_specific_scores": 2.5}

At your age, if your sexual desire is normal and your secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair, pubic hair growth is normal then your testosterone production is normal.

However, many men with one testis are still able to father children.\n\n2. **Hormonal Imbalances:** The testes produce testosterone, which is essential for male sexual development and function. Having one testis may result in slightly lower testosterone levels, but it's usually not significant enough to cause major issues.\n\n3. **Increased Risk of Testicular Cancer:** Men with one testis have a slightly higher risk of developing testicular cancer in the remaining testis. Regular self-examinations and doctor check-ups are recommended for early detection.\n\n**Regarding your sexual experiences:**\n\n1. **Penetration Difficulty:** Difficulty penetrating during sex can be due to various factors, including performance anxiety, lack of lubrication, or other physical or psychological issues.
