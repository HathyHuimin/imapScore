The brown discharge should be temporary. I would recommend you have a period for the next couple of months and not skip the placebo pills temporarily to get back on track. If you have not missed any pills, pregnancy is very unlikely, but I would recommend a pregnancy test for added reassurance. If you have not had a recent test for STDs, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, I would also get tested for those, as these infections may have no symptoms and can cause spotting or bleeding after intercourse.

It's not uncommon to experience some irregular bleeding or spotting while on the Yaz contraceptive pill, especially if you have skipped your sugar pills.

Here, although you do experience floaters just like in posterior vitreous detachment, the floaters are more numerous and keep increasing with time. You will also have a reduction in vision with nonseeing areas in your visual field. This often needs to be treated surgically. I recommend you to visit an ophthalmologist.

When they are removed, there is no longer this pressure present, and the second molars can begin to shift slightly, causing some minor changes to the alignment of teeth.

Montoux test, PPD test is a very non-specific test and does not give you any confirmation for tuberculosis. It is used as an adjuvant test for diagnosis and never as sole test. It is read after 48 hours of injection. You have not mentioned the duration. You have to measure its diameter. It should be less then 10 x 10 mm. I cannot measure it online but apparently it is negative for tuberculosis (attachment removed to protect patient identity).", "chatgpt_prediction": "I am an AI language model and do not have the ability to view any images. However, as an AI language model, I can tell you that the tuberculosis skin test, or PPD test, is a commonly used method to diagnose tuberculosis infection. The test involves injecting a small amount of purified protein derivative (PPD) under the skin and then checking the injection site for a reaction after 48-72 hours. If a raised red bump appears at the site, it may indicate a previous or current tuberculosis infection. In your case, it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider who can review the results of your skin test and provide an accurate diagnosis based on your medical history and physical examination.", "Average_accuracy_score": 1.0, "Average_completeness_score": 1.5, "Average_specific_scores": 0.0}

{"Question": "Hi doctor,Yesterday I had to have a frenuloplasty. I had to have a general anaesthetic. I woke up and never got any advice off the urologist because I never saw him after the procedure. The nurse who discharged me told me to take off the dressing in the morning and wash the wound and the foreskin twice daily. My concern is today I noticed my foreskin has become swollen and looks similar to a balloon. The stitches are preventing me from pulling my foreskin back over the glans.
